# skice

A command-line tool for creative coding using HTML canvas. It helps to create and work with locally
hosted projects for small experiments or large artworks. `skice` is heavily inspired by a similar but
much more feature-rich tool called [cvanvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch).
Unlike "canvas-sketch" it doesn't provide an abstraction layer and the code you write is directly
sent to the browser as is.

## Installation

```
npm install -g skice
```

## Usage

```
skice <command> [<path>] [options...]
```

## Commands
### help, --help, -h

Outputs the help text either for `skice` or the specified command.

```bash
skice help

skice help run
```

### version

Outputs the version number.

```bash
skice version
```

### new

Creates a new sketch project.

```bash
skice new /path/to/sketch_project --context webgl

skice new /path/to/sketch_project --context 2d
```

### run

Runs the project using a local server.

```bash
cd /path/to/sketch_project

skice run

skice run --port 8000

skice run --no-browser
```

### upgrade

Upgrades the project from an older version.

```bash
skice upgrade /path/to/sketch_project --from 1.4.1 --context webgl
```

## Configuration

Every project has a **skice.config.json** file in its root that you can use to change the configuration.

### portNumber

Specifies the port number that is used by the local server. It can be overwritten with the
command-line option `--port`.

### watch

skice will automatically reload the browser when files in the project directory change.
It's watching recursively all the files by default, but since it's using Node's file watcher API,
it has some [caveats](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#caveats) that might prevent this
functionality from working properly on your system. One way to mitigate certain issues is to add a
list of files that need to be watched using `watch` configuration option.

```json
{
  "skiceVersion": "2.1.0",
  "portNumber": 3000,
  "watch": [
    "index.html",
    "js/skice.js"
  ]
}
```

The file paths must be relative to the root directory.

## Canvas settings

`skice` projects have access to `CanvasSettings` class which provides some useful functionality
like automatic resizing and image export.

### CanvasSettings#width

The width of the canvas element. It will change automatically when the browser window
gets smaller than this value.

### CanvasSettings#height

The height of the canvas element. It will change automatically when the browser window
gets smaller than this value.

### CanvasSettings#exportAs

The export format. The default is `image`.

Possible values:

- image (exports as a PNG file)
- video/* (* can be any video format supported by the browser, e.g., video/webm)

### CanvasSettings#duration

The duration of the video file if a video format is used for the `exportAs` setting. It must be in
milliseconds. The default value is `5000`.

### CanvasSettings#enableExport()

Enables exporting canvas in the specified format using a keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S`.

```js
const canvasSettings = new CanvasSettings()

canvasSettings.enableExport(canvas, renderer, scene, camera)
```

## `network` module

This module provides convenience function for working with network requests.

Available functions:
- importPlainText(url: string): Promise<string> - loads a plain text file. It can be useful for importing GLSL files.

## Upgrading from 1.4.1 to 2.x

If you have a sketch file created by `skice` 1.4.1 or an older file that has been updated to work with
1.4.1, it can be easily updated to work with 2.x using [`upgrade` command](#upgrade).

## Upgrading from 1.3.2 to 1.4.1

Some of the functionality has been moved from the HTML template to the sketch file in preparation for
version 2.0.0. Refer to the updated [Canvas 2D](templates/2d_sketch.js) and [WebGL](templates/webgl_sketch.js)
sketch templates to see what code needs to be changed, but the most important part is to add `CanvasSettings`
import and instantiation as well as a reference to the canvas element to your existing sketches like this.

```js
import CanvasSettings from 'canvas_settings'

const canvas = document.getElementById('sketch_canvas')
const canvasSettings = new CanvasSettings()
```

Alternatively you can keep the old naming convention.

```js
import CanvasSettings from 'canvas_settings'

const canvas = document.getElementById('sketch_canvas')
const CANVAS_SETTINGS = new CanvasSettings()
```
